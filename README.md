<p>Group members: Zixuan Guo, Yilan Dong</p>
<p>This assignment explores the use of interfaces, polymorphism. Part A and B focus on subtype polymorphism, and we developed classes to truncate, center and rightjustified textblocks, and experimented the immutable nature of strings. In part C and D, we developed a project to simulate a shopping cart, where we can add Items, calculate the price, print contents, remove items and merge identical items.</p>
